This project is a desktop calculator application developed in Java using the Swing framework. The application provides a graphical user interface that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations in an intuitive and user-friendly way. It was created to demonstrate foundational programming concepts such as event handling, control flow, and GUI design in Java.

The calculator supports the four core arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can input numbers using on-screen buttons, work with decimal values, and view results instantly in a non-editable display field. The program processes user input through action listeners and applies the appropriate mathematical logic based on the selected operator.

The graphical interface is built using JFrame, JPanel, JButton, and JTextField. A grid layout is used for the numeric and operator buttons, while custom styling and positioning are applied to create a clean and structured layout. The application manages calculations using internal variables to store operands and operators, and uses a switch statement to evaluate expressions accurately.

This project was developed as a learning exercise to strengthen understanding of Java GUI development, event-driven programming, and debugging common logic errors. It also served as practical experience using Git and GitHub for version control and project sharing.

Future improvements may include enhanced error handling, keyboard input support, additional mathematical functions, and a more flexible layout that adapts to different screen sizes. Overall, this calculator application represents a solid introduction to building functional desktop applications in Java.
